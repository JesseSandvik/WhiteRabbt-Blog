# WhiteRabbt

This application is a full-stack blog application built to blog about tech, software development, and just personal growth.

This is the first project I've built using Next.js, Prisma, as well as TypeScript.

The full-stack is React/Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, SASS/SCSS, and postgreSQL. The project will be deployed using Vercel.

I really had to take my time working through this project and I learned so much in the process.

# Installation

Fork & Clone the repository, run rpm install to install project dependencies. You will need to set up your own database, env file, etc.

# Usage

As mentioned above, this is a blog application with the intent to be used to talk about my journey through tech. I didn't want to take the "easy way out"
and just build an application in something I was already familiar with. I also didn't want to just utilize one of the many already existing online blog websites.
I considered this a good chance to work my way through a full-stack project I could be creative with, while still challenging myself and learning some new technologies.

# Contributing

I ask at this time to please refrain from contributing to these files. Feel free to review the code, offer some feature requests, etc.

I hope you enjoy the project, thanks for stopping by!
